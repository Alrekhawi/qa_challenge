Title:
Rate Button Not Enabled When Selecting 10 Stars in Top Box Office

Environment: PROD
URL: https://www.imdb.com/

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Navigate to https://www.imdb.com/.
2. Open the Menu by clicking on the menu icon in the top left corner.
3. Select "Top Box Office" from the menu.
4. Click on the second item in the Top Box Office list to go to the movie's detail page.
5. Click on the IMDb Rating button.
6. Attempt to rate the movie by selecting 10 stars.
7. Observe the state of the "Rate" button.


Actual Result:

The "Rate" button remains disabled when 10 stars are selected, preventing the user from submitting their rating.

Screen shot or a video should be attached too for reference. 


Expected Result:

The "Rate" button should be enabled after selecting 10 stars, allowing the user to submit their rating.


Severity:
High – Users are unable to rate movies with the maximum rating, which could affect user experience and data accuracy.

Priority:
P1 – This issue should be addressed in the next release due to its impact on user interaction and functionality.



Additional Information:

This issue does not occur when selecting any other number of stars (1-9). The "Rate" button is correctly enabled for those selections.
The issue is reproducible on both Chrome and Firefox browsers across different operating systems.
Suggested Fix:

Investigate the logic that enables the "Rate" button to ensure it triggers correctly when 10 stars are selected.
Review any recent changes to the rating system that might have introduced this regression.
